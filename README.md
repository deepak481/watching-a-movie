# 'Watching A Movie' Application Documentation

## Overview

This Movie Browser application is a responsive, mobile-first web app built using React. It allows users to search for movies, view details, filter results, and save favorites.

## Design Decisions

1. **Framework Choice**: React was chosen for its component-based architecture, which allows for reusable UI elements and efficient rendering.

2. **API**: The application uses the TMDB (The Movie Database) API for fetching movie data due to its comprehensive database and well-documented API.

3. **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback) are used for local state management. For more complex state management, we could consider using Redux or Context API in the future.

4. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS was used for rapid UI development and to ensure a consistent, responsive design across devices.

5. **Infinite Scrolling**: A custom infinite scroll implementation was created to handle large numbers of search results efficiently.

6. **Favorites Feature**: Browser's local storage is used to persist user's favorite movies, allowing for a seamless experience across sessions without requiring user authentication.

7. **SEO and Accessibility**: Semantic HTML elements, ARIA attributes, and proper heading structure were implemented to enhance accessibility and SEO.

## How to Run the Application

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-browser.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd movie-browser
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your TMDB API key:

   ```
   VITE_TMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

5. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open your browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`

## Additional Features Implemented

1. **Advanced Filtering**: Users can filter movies by genre, release year range, and rating range.

2. **Favorites Management**: Users can save and remove favorite movies, which are stored in local storage.

3. **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and works well on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.

4. **Error Handling**: Proper error messages are displayed when API calls fail or no results are found.

5. **Loading States**: Loading indicators are shown during API calls to improve user experience.

## Possible Improvements

1. **Performance Optimization**: Implement server-side rendering or static site generation for improved initial load times and SEO.

2. **State Management**: For larger scale applications, consider implementing Redux or Context API for more robust state management.

3. **Testing**: Add unit tests and integration tests to ensure code reliability and ease of maintenance.

4. **Internationalization**: Implement multi-language support to cater to a global audience.

5. **PWA Features**: Convert the application into a Progressive Web App for offline capabilities and improved mobile experience.

6. **User Accounts**: Implement user authentication to allow for cross-device syncing of favorites and personalized recommendations.

7. **Advanced Search**: Implement more advanced search features like fuzzy search or searching by actor/director names.

8. **Caching**: Implement client-side caching of API responses to reduce API calls and improve performance.

9. **Accessibility Improvements**: Conduct a thorough accessibility audit and implement any necessary improvements.

10. **Code Splitting**: Implement code splitting to reduce the initial bundle size and improve load times.
